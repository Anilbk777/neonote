# User Model Fix for NeoNote Web App

## Problem

When a user tries to register, the following error occurs:

```
null value in column "is_active" of relation "accounts_customuser" violates not-null constraint
```

This happens because the CustomUser model is missing required fields that Django expects for user authentication.

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issues identified:

1. The CustomUser model inherits from AbstractBaseUser but doesn't include all the required fields
2. The is_active field is required in the database but not defined in the model
3. The serializer doesn't set default values for required fields

## Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive fix that addresses the user model issues:

### 1. Updated CustomUser Model

- Added PermissionsMixin to the inheritance chain to include permission-related fields
- Added is_active field with default=True
- Added is_staff field with default=False
- Added date_joined field with auto_now_add=True
- Updated the CustomUserManager to set is_active=True when creating users
- Added create_superuser method to the CustomUserManager

### 2. Updated CustomUserSerializer

- Added is_active and is_staff to the fields list
- Set default values and made them read-only in extra_kwargs
- Explicitly set is_active=True in the create method

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Files:

1. `core/accounts/models.py`
   - Updated CustomUser model to include required fields
   - Enhanced CustomUserManager with proper user creation methods

2. `core/accounts/serializers.py`
   - Updated serializer to handle the new fields
   - Added default values for required fields

## Database Migration

After making these changes, you need to create and apply migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations accounts
python manage.py migrate
```

## Testing

To test this fix:

1. Try registering a new user
2. Verify that the registration completes without errors
3. Check that the user can log in successfully
4. Verify that the user has is_active=True in the database

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced User Model**
   - Add more user profile fields (profile picture, bio, etc.)
   - Implement email verification for new accounts
   - Add account deactivation functionality

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Implement password strength validation
   - Add two-factor authentication
   - Add login attempt limiting to prevent brute force attacks
